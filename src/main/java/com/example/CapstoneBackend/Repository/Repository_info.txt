WHAT IS A REPOSITORY?
It allows us to call CRUD (create, read, update, delete) APIs on our entities. 
We can also create findby[whatever variable we have]. For the create spelling,
look at documentation- forgot exactly, but it will map our own variables to 
these more specific APIs. 

WHO USES REPOSITORIES?
The Command class will use it to make changes or read from our db.
