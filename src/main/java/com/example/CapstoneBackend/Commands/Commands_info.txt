WHAT IS A COMMNAD?
Commands allow us to hold all the business logic required
on our entities. 

EXAMPLE?
Do we need to do checking on certain values before sending to our db? If so,
then create a command that will hold the logic to do so. 

WHERE WILL THIS BE USED?
Commands will be used in the Controller classes

WHAT CLASSES WILL BE IN THIS?
A repository class and an entity class. 
Anytime we wanna talk to the db, we will call a Repository class to return
an entity to a Controller class. 

If we add error handling, have it throw an error and we will handle this thrown error in the 
Controller class!
