WHAT IS A COMMNAD?
Commands allow us to hold all the business logic required
on our entities. 

EXAMPLE?
Do we need to do checking on certain values before sending to our db? If so,
then create a command that will hold the logic to do so. 

WHERE WILL THIS BE USED?
Commands will be used in the Controller classes

WHAT CLASSES WILL BE IN THIS?
Anytime we wanna talk to the db, we will call a Repository class to return
entities. With our returned entity, we could call a getter to return a specific value.
