WHAT IS A CONTROLLER?
Controllers allow us to perform API calls or to create them ourselves. 
We can call other endpoints by using the @GET annotation or @POST to 
send data to other services. 

WHAT WILL OUR CONTROLLERS RETURN? 
It will return a ResponseEntity with a http status and DTO attached to it. 

Note: no business logic should be here. We will be calling the Command classes
